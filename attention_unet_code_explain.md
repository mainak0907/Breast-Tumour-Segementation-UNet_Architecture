## Attention Gates Convolution (`attention_gates`):

- **Conv2D**: This layer applies a 2D convolutional operation with:
  - 256 filters
  - Kernel size of 2x2
  - 'relu' activation function
  - 'same' padding
- Input: Output feature maps from the previous convolutional layer `conv4`.

## Attention Upsampling (`attention_upsample`):

- **Conv2DTranspose**: This layer performs transposed convolution, also known as deconvolution, with:
  - 256 filters
  - Kernel size of 2x2
  - Stride of (2, 2) for upsampling
  - 'same' padding
- Input: Feature maps obtained from the previous attention gates layer, upsampled to match the size of the feature maps from an earlier convolutional layer `conv3`.

## Concatenation (`attention_concat`):

- **concatenate**: This function concatenates:
  - The upsampled feature maps from the previous step (`attention_upsample`).
  - The feature maps from an earlier convolutional layer `conv3`.
- Axis: Concatenation along the channel axis (axis=3).

## Attention Convolution (`attention_conv`):

- Two consecutive **Conv2D** layers: Each layer applies a 2D convolutional operation with:
  - 256 filters
  - Kernel size of 3x3
  - 'relu' activation function
  - 'same' padding
- Processing: These layers process the concatenated feature maps obtained from the previous step.

## Attention Gate (`attention_gate`):

- **Conv2D**: This layer applies a 2D convolutional operation with:
  - Single filter (output channels=1)
  - Kernel size of 1x1
  - Activation function: 'sigmoid'
- Output: Computes the attention coefficients (attention gate) for each spatial location of the feature maps obtained from the previous attention convolution step.

## Attention Multiplication (`attention_multiply`):

- **tf.multiply**: This function performs element-wise multiplication between:
  - The feature maps from an earlier convolutional layer `conv3`.
  - The attention gate computed in the previous step.
- Operation: Selectively amplifies or suppresses features in `conv3` based on the attention coefficients computed by the attention gate.
